- Re-added FunctionsAPI until the next major release to let users to implement an alternative #23

Version 2.0.0
--------------

Refactored fetching resource collections:
- SQL query optimizations for 'include' and 'relationship' objects, using `selectinload`
  (3x-5x performance improvement when tested on large datasets)

- New parameter 'include_links' which controls should relationship objects include links. They are not required by
  JSON API, and disabling them significantly improves performance

- New interfaces for Serializer and Deserializer classes.

- APIManager requires Serializer/Deserializer objects instead of functions for `serializer`/`deserializer` options

Deprecations:
- 'single' parameter is no longer supported - makes code complicated, is not defined in JSON API specs and can be easily
  replicated on a client side

- 'group' parameter is not longer supported - not defined in JSON API specifications, confusing and broken for PostrgeSQL

- JSONP callbacks are no longer supported - please reach out if you have a use case for them
